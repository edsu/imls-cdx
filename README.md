These are working programs, data and notebooks from the Museums Group at 
Archives Unleased workshop in Washington DC, June 14-15.

Internet Archive did a crawl of museum websites documented by [IMLS] and 
the [CDX files] for the crawl. We then attempted to process the CDX files to
learn something about the Museum websites.
