    "# Analyzing US Museum Websites with Web Archives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created during the [Archives Unleashed] event held in Washington DC on June 14-15.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[IMLS] maintains the [Museums Universal Data File] which is a census of museums in the United States. Conveniently the database is available for download as a [dataset] in CSV format. The [ArchiveIt] folks at Internet Archive pulled the website URLs from the CSV and then used them to create a seed list for a (big) web crawl. The 10 gigabytes of [CDX files] for those crawls were made available as a dataset for use during Archives Unleashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With your archivist hat on (if you have one) you can think of [CDX] files as a *finding aid* for the Web crawl data, or WARC data files. They document what URLs were requested, what the [response code] was (404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, 200 OK, etc), the size of the response, the media type of the response (text/html, image/jpeg, etc), as well as other metadata to aid in seeking within the CDX file and in the corresponding WARC file to get the actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought that perhaps it might be interesting to augment the IMLS data file with information from the crawl, such as the total number of pages on the museums website, the total size of resources hosted, the number of missing resources, etc. In addition we thought it could be interesting to look at the data through the lens of the museum's income.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to augment the IMLS table with data from the CDX file I chose to read the CDX file and count attributes of the request (status code, mimetype, size, etc) using [Redis]. Unfortunately we found out during the processing that there is a great deal of duplicate URLs in the crawl: a given URL may have been crawled many times. So we also needed to only tally the first occurrence of the resource, and ignore the rest, so that our results don't favor resources that were requested many times by the crawler. You can see the resulting program here in [index.py].\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been processed into Redis you can then run [augment.py] which will read in the existing CSV file, and write out a new CSV with the additional columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "* pages: number of *unique* pages requested\n",
    "* size: total size in bytes received from a domain\n",
    "* 404: number of Not Found errors at a domain\n",
    "* 500: number of Internal Server Errors at a domain\n",
    "* robots: \n",
    "\n",
    "More columns could be added, such as number of images (jpeg, tiff, etc) if desirable. This notebook uses the [augmented CSV dataset] to examine a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* These results are preliminary, index.py is still running after 10 hours! It appears to be 75% done, so these results are impartial. Maybe I should have tried [ArchiveSpark] or something.  Sigh. I'll update the notebook with the latest CSV when it completes.\n",
    "* Any Website URLs that were at a path within a larger site were ignored in this analysis. The reason being that it is not clear where one website begins and another ends unless there is a naked domain.\n",
    "* Naked domains are only a limited view of a particular organizations web space. It could be that they have a lot of content at another domain.\n",
    "* The web crawl ran for 3 months, but still hasn't completed. According to [Jefferson] it apparently is stuck in some NFL website at the moment.\n",
